In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from 
lowest to highest, in the following way: 

High Card: Highest value card. 

One Pair: Two cards of the same value. 

Two Pairs: Two different pairs. 

Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value. 

Straight: All cards are consecutive values. 

Flush: All cards of the same suit. 

Full House: Three of a kind and a pair. 

Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value. 

Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit. 

Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit. 

The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, 
King, Ace. 

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest 
value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 
below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, 
then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the 
highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on. 

Consider the following five hands dealt to two players: 

 

Hand Player 1 Player 2 Winner 

1 5H 5C 6S 7S KDPair of Fives
